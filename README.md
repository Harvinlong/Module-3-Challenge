## Purpose of this Project: 

In this project, I analyzed the additional data for the commission's election audit, including the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. This would help the audience understand what they could do with the presented data.

## Steps:

Initialize a county list and dictionary and do the next things: 
1: Check if each row's county is in the list and add it if not.
2: increment the vote count for each county.
3: Calculate each county's percentage of votes and print it out.
4: determine the county with the largest turnout, and print out the county with the highest turnout. 

## Result:
